## üîÑ Next Steps for Full Blockchain Integration

### 1. Smart Contract Deployment
- [ ] Install aeproject CLI: `npm install -g @aeternity/aeproject`
- [ ] Initialize contract project
- [ ] Copy `src/contracts/EmpowerChain.aes` to contract project
- [ ] Compile contract: `aeproject compile`
- [ ] Deploy to testnet: `aeproject deploy`
- [ ] Save deployed contract address

### 2. Frontend Integration
- [ ] Install Superhero Wallet extension
- [ ] Update `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `src/lib/aeternity.ts`
- [ ] Implement real wallet connection using `@aeternity/aepp-sdk`
- [ ] Replace mock functions with actual contract calls
- [ ] Test all contract interactions on testnet

### 3. Contract ABI Integration
After compiling the contract, you'll get a JSON ABI file. Import it:

```typescript
import contractACI from './contracts/EmpowerChain.json';
```

### 4. Real Wallet Connection
Replace the mock `connectWallet` function:

```typescript
import { AeSdk, Node, BrowserWindowMessageConnection } from '@aeternity/aepp-sdk';

export async function connectWallet() {
  const scannerConnection = new BrowserWindowMessageConnection();
  
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    scannerConnection.connect(({ wallets }) => {
      const wallet = Object.values(wallets)[0];
      
      const aeSdk = new AeSdk({
        nodes: [{ name: 'testnet', instance: new Node(TESTNET_NODE) }],
      });
      
      aeSdk.connectToWallet(wallet.connection)
        .then(() => aeSdk.address())
        .then(resolve)
        .catch(reject);
    });
  });
}
```

### 5. Contract Function Calls
Replace mock implementations with real contract calls:

```typescript
export async function createProject(aeSdk, projectData) {
  const contract = await aeSdk.initializeContract({
    address: CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
    aci: contractACI,
  });
  
  const result = await contract.create_project(
    projectData.studentName,
    projectData.projectTitle,
    projectData.description,
    aeToAettos(projectData.fundingGoal),
    projectData.category,
    projectData.milestones.map(m => m.description),
    projectData.milestones.map(m => aeToAettos(m.amount))
  );
  
  return result;
}
```

### 6. Testing Workflow
1. **Get Testnet AE**
   - Visit https://faucet.aepps.com/
   - Enter your wallet address
   - Receive testnet AE

2. **Test Contract Deployment**
   - Deploy contract to testnet
   - Verify deployment on [Aeternity Explorer](https://explorer.testnet.aeternity.io/)

3. **Test Frontend**
   - Connect wallet
   - Create a test project
   - Make a test donation
   - Vote on milestones
   - Verify all transactions on explorer

### 7. Production Deployment
- [ ] Audit smart contract
- [ ] Deploy to Aeternity mainnet
- [ ] Update frontend configuration for mainnet
- [ ] Deploy frontend to hosting service
- [ ] Configure custom domain
- [ ] Set up monitoring and analytics

## üêõ Common Issues

### Wallet Not Found
**Problem:** "Superhero Wallet not found" error  
**Solution:** Install Superhero Wallet extension and refresh page

### Transaction Failed
**Problem:** Transaction rejected or failed  
**Solution:** 
- Ensure sufficient AE balance for gas
- Verify you're on correct network (testnet/mainnet)
- Check contract address is correct

### Contract Call Error
**Problem:** Contract function call fails  
**Solution:**
- Verify all parameters are correct type
- Check you have permission for the action
- Ensure contract is deployed and active

## üéØ Feature Roadmap

### Phase 1 (Current)
- ‚úÖ Basic UI and contract structure
- ‚úÖ Project creation and donations
- ‚úÖ Milestone tracking

### Phase 2 (Next)
- [ ] Real-time blockchain data synchronization
- [ ] Enhanced milestone voting system
- [ ] Project categories and filtering
- [ ] Search functionality

### Phase 3 (Future)
- [ ] Profile pages for students
- [ ] Donor recognition system
- [ ] Impact reporting and analytics
- [ ] Multi-currency support
- [ ] Mobile app version

## üí° Tips

1. **Start with Testnet**: Always test thoroughly on testnet before mainnet
2. **Gas Estimation**: Estimate gas costs before transactions
3. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
4. **User Feedback**: Provide clear feedback for all blockchain operations
5. **Security**: Never expose private keys, audit all code

## üîê Security Checklist

- [ ] Smart contract audited by professionals
- [ ] All user inputs validated
- [ ] Private keys never stored or logged
- [ ] HTTPS enabled for production
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented
- [ ] Transaction signing properly handled
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
